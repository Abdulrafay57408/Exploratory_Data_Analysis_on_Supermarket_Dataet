# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Supermarket Dataset

This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Supermarket dataset, which contains transactional data from a retail store. The goal is to uncover sales patterns, analyze customer behavior, and create new features to enhance data understanding and usability.

### Features of this Project:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** 
  - Creating new features, such as **Total Sales** (unit price Ã— quantity), **Sales per Customer**, and **Profit Margin**.
  - Categorizing data, such as grouping sales by day of the week or time of day.
  - Calculating aggregated metrics like average sales per transaction and customer frequency.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating meaningful visualizations (e.g., sales trends over time, product category performance, customer demographics) to identify patterns and insights.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing sales data through key metrics, including total revenue, average purchase size, and top-performing products.
- **Insights Generation:** Highlighting key findings, such as peak sales periods, top product categories, and high-value customer segments.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data wrangling and feature creation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: For writing, executing, and sharing the analysis in an interactive cloud-based environment.

### Purpose:
This project showcases how EDA can be applied to transactional datasets to uncover actionable insights for business decision-making. The focus is on preparing the data, deriving meaningful features, and visualizing trends to guide strategy and operational improvements.
